/**
 * @class Listener
 * @brief Manages a network listening socket and its associated virtual servers.
 *
 * The Listener class encapsulates a single listening socket along with metadata
 * about which virtual servers should handle connections on that socket. It provides
 * RAII management of the file descriptor through UniqueFD and maintains the mapping
 * between network endpoints and virtual server configurations.
 *
 * ## Key Features:
 * - **RAII Socket Management**: Automatic cleanup via UniqueFD
 * - **Virtual Server Mapping**: Associates multiple virtual servers with one listener
 * - **IPv4/IPv6 Support**: Tracks protocol version for proper handling
 * - **Non-copyable**: Prevents accidental duplication of socket resources
 *
 * ## Usage Pattern:
 * 1. Create Listener with socket FD and network details
 * 2. Associate virtual server indices via setVirtualServerIndices()
 * 3. Register with event loop using getFD()
 * 4. Route incoming connections using virtualServerIndices()
 *
 * @note This class is non-copyable to prevent socket descriptor duplication.
 * @warning File descriptor ownership is transferred to UniqueFD on construction.
