/**
 * @class Server
 * @brief High-level web server manager implementing virtual hosting and event-driven I/O.
 *
 * The Server class orchestrates the complete lifecycle of a multi-virtual-host web server.
 * It handles listener creation, event loop management, and provides efficient request routing
 * based on Host headers. The implementation follows RAII principles and is designed for
 * C++98 compatibility.
 *
 * ## Key Features:
 * - **Virtual Hosting**: Multiple virtual servers can share listeners on the same port
 * - **Event-Driven**: Non-blocking I/O with epoll/kqueue event loop integration  
 * - **Robust Networking**: IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack support with comprehensive error handling
 * - **Memory Safe**: RAII-based resource management prevents leaks under all conditions
 * - **Fast Routing**: O(log n) Host header lookup via pre-built hostname maps
 *
 * ## Lifecycle:
 * 1. **Construction**: Server(config) - Validates configuration, initializes empty state
 * 2. **Startup**: start() - Creates listeners, registers with event loop, builds routing maps
 * 3. **Operation**: Event loop processes connections, routes requests via host maps
 * 4. **Shutdown**: stop() or destructor - Graceful cleanup of all resources
 *
 * ## Thread Safety:
 * This class is **not thread-safe**. All operations must be performed from a single thread.
 *
 * ## Exception Safety:
 * - **Constructor**: Basic guarantee - object construction may fail but no leaks
 * - **start()**: Strong guarantee - either fully succeeds or leaves server in stopped state  
 * - **stop()**: No-throw guarantee - always succeeds and cleans up resources
 * - **Destructor**: No-throw guarantee - automatic cleanup via RAII
 *
 * @warning ServerConfig reference must remain valid for the Server's entire lifetime.
 * @note Designed for single-threaded event-driven servers. Use multiple Server instances for multi-threading.
